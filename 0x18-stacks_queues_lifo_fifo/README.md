# 0x18. C - Stacks, Queues - LIFO, FIFO
---
## Name

Monty - a scripting language that is first compiled into Monty byte codes (Just like Python). It relies on a unique stack, with specific instructions to manipulate it.

## Description

The goal of this project is to create an interpreter for Monty ByteCodes files.

#### This project in the Higher Level Programming series is about:

 * What do LIFO and FIFO mean
 * What is a stack, and when to use it
 * What is a queue, and when to use it
 * What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
 * What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
 * What is the proper way to use global variables
 * How to work with git submodules

## Requirements

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 * Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 * You allowed to use a maximum of one global variable
 * No more than 5 functions per file
 * You are allowed to use the C standard library
 * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called monty.h
 * Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
 * All your header files should be include guarded
 * You are expected to do the tasks in the order shown in the project
 * The repository monty should be added as a submodule to your holbertonschool-low_level_programming repository, under the name 0x18-stacks_queues_lifo_fifo
