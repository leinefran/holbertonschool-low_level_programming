# 0x1C. C - Binary trees

### This project in the Lower Level Programming series is about:

 * What is a binary tree
 * What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
 * What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
 * What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
 * What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
 * What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree

## Requirements

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 * Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 * You are not allowed to use global variables
 * No more than 5 functions per file
 * You are allowed to use the standard library
 * All your header files should be include guarded
