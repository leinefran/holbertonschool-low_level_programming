# 0x19. C - Hash tables

### This project in the Lower Level Programming series is about:

 * What is a hash function
 * What makes a good hash function
 * What is a hash table, how do they work and how to use them
 * What is a collision and what are the main ways of dealing with collisions in the context of a hash table
 * What are the advantages and drawbacks of using hash tables
 * What are the most common use cases of hash tables

## Requirements

 * Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
 * All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
 * Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
 * All your files should end with a new line
 * A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
 * Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
 * You are not allowed to use global variables
 * No more than 5 functions per file
 * You are allowed to use the C standard library
 * The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called hash_tables.h
 * Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
 * All your header files should be include guarded


Please use these data structures for this project:

/**
 * struct hash_node_s - Node of a hash table
 *
 * @key: The key, string
 * The key is unique in the HashTable
 * @value: The value corresponding to a key
 * @next: A pointer to the next node of the List
 */
typedef struct hash_node_s
{
     char *key;
     char *value;
     struct hash_node_s *next;
} hash_node_t;

/**
 * struct hash_table_s - Hash table data structure
 *
 * @size: The size of the array
 * @array: An array of size @size
 * Each cell of this array is a pointer to the first node of a linked list,
 * because we want our HashTable to use a Chaining collision handling
 */
typedef struct hash_table_s
{
     unsigned long int size;
     hash_node_t **array;
} hash_table_t;
